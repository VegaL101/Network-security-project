# Network-security-project

## Objective

Our objective is to simulate two networks separated by three VLANs per site, while enhancing their security posture through the implementation of firewalls, DMZs (Demilitarized Zones), and site-to-site VPNs. 

### Skills Learned

- Learned how to implement VLANs
- configure firewalls
- Configure DMZ
- Configure site-to-site VPN

## Steps

Step 1:
Create the network layout

Firstly we add our two routers with 3 switches for each router. We set up our layout like below.

We then add our end devices. we'll only be using PCs for this project. There will be 12 PCs in total, 3 for a switch on each floor. We have them set up like below.
