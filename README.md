# Network-security-project

## Objective

Our objective is to simulate two networks separated by three VLANs per site, while enhancing their security posture through the implementation of firewalls, DMZs (Demilitarized Zones), and site-to-site VPNs. 

### Skills Learned

- Learned how to implement VLANs
- configure firewalls
- Configure DMZ
- Configure site-to-site VPN

## Steps

Step 1:
Create the network layout

Firstly we add our two ro

The with statement is used with the .open()  function to open and read the contents of the file. The output of the code is stored within a file variable which has the .read()  function applied to it which converts the file to a string which can be read. Then we assign that within the ip_addresses variable.

Step 2:
Convert the string into a list.
