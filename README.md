# Network-security-project

## Objective

Our objective is to simulate two networks separated by three VLANs per site, while enhancing their security posture through the implementation of firewalls, DMZs (Demilitarized Zones), and site-to-site VPNs. 

### Skills Learned

- Learned how to implement VLANs
- configure firewalls
- Configure DMZ
- Configure site-to-site VPN

## Steps

Step 1:
Create the network layout

Firstly we add our two routers with four switches for each router. We set up our layout like below.

##

We then add our end devices. we'll only be using PCs for this project. There will be 18 PCs in total, 3 for every switch.


The with statement is used with the .open()  function to open and read the contents of the file. The output of the code is stored within a file variable which has the .read()  function applied to it which converts the file to a string which can be read. Then we assign that within the ip_addresses variable.

Step 2:
Convert the string into a list.
